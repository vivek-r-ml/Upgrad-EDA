This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) assignment on the NYC Taxi dataset. 
The goal of this analysis is to uncover key insights, identify patterns, and better understand the behavior of taxi rides across New York City using visualizations and summary statistics.

Contents:
1. Jupyter Notebook with the Code. 
2. Report containing visualizations, analysis, results, insights, and outcomes.

Dataset:
1. The dataset used is a public release of NYC Yellow Taxi trip records, containing trip-level details such as pickup/dropoff timestamps, locations, fare amount, passenger count, and more.
2. The taxizone shape file has also been used which provides geometric data about taxi zones.

Tools & Libraries:
1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
2. Jupyter Notebook
